  "instructions": [
    "Prep all the ingredients before getting started. Slice the flank steak into thin bite-sized strips, and cut the broccoli into small florets.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients with a whisk.",
    "In a skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Cook the broccoli until tender-crisp, tossing often, and transfer it to a plate.",
    "Add the remaining oil to the skillet. Place the beef in the pan in a uniform layer. Let it cook for a minute, then flip with kitchen tongs and continue to cook for another minute or so.",
    "Add the broccoli back in along with the brown sauce, and cook until the sauce has thickened up.",
    "Have everything prepped in advance. The actual cooking part is very quick, so all the ingredients should be ready to go beforehand so that you can cook with confidence and ease!",
    "You're going to want to cook it on high heat to get that great sear. I recommend using a cast iron skillet if you can.",
    "Don't overcook the steak. Since we're cutting it thinly, it really doesn't take long at all. Flank steak is quite lean, which means that it can be overcooked easily.",
    "Slice beef thinly against the grain.",
    "Marinate beef in soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and cornstarch for 15 minutes.",
    "Heat sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.",
    "Add beef and stir-fry until browned. Remove from skillet.",
    "Add broccoli to the skillet and stir-fry for 3-5 minutes until tender-crisp.",
    "Return beef to the skillet.",
    "Add a splash more soy sauce if desired.",
    "Stir everything together for 1 minute.",
    "Serve immediately over rice."
